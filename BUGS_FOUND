dlist iter-trait EACH implementation forgot to check rv
test failures give no useful information if failure string not specified
 - a span (or even backtrace? perhaps with a verbose flag) would be nice
dvec add reverse; vec add reach
vec add map_mut?

test cases that have the same name don't do what they should

A common idiom is "while x.is_some() { x.get() .. x = ..; }". Encapsulate?
