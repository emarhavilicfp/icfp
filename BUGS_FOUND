dlist iter-trait EACH implementation forgot to check rv

test failures give no useful information if failure string not specified
 - a span (or even backtrace? perhaps with a verbose flag) would be nice

dvec add reverse; vec add reach

vec add map_mut?

negative constants don't work

std::test should have a way to mark expected values

test cases that have the same name don't do what they should

A common idiom is "while x.is_some() { x.get() .. x = ..; }". Encapsulate?

I have nothing to add.
...oh, I do. Even with #[warn(no_implicit_copys)] at the top of the function,
it still warns.
