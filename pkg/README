Emarhavil Heavy Functional Programming
======================================

ABOUT US
--------

We're a team based in Mountain View, CA; we unite around the fact that we
wish to try implementing an ICFP challenge in Mozilla's new experimental
language, Rust [1].  Our explicit goals for this iteration of the
competition are to 1) have fun, and 2) put Rust on the map, giving it a
serious test of something other than the Rust compiler written in it.

We would like to thank the Mozilla Corporation for allowing us the use of
their office space over the weekend (keeping the lights and AC on for us,
and keeping us fed!).

OUR LIGHTNING ROUND SUBMISSION
------------------------------

We submit some mostly untested pathfinding code that might or might not
work.
